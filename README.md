# OS_BankingAlgorithm
  
  Banker’s algorithm includes:  
1. The safety algorithm
2. The request algorithm  

Inputs :  
• Allocation and Maximum matrices and the available resources vector as in the
following example  
• The user can enquiry if the system is in a safe state  
• The user can enquiry if a certain immediate request by one of the processes can be
granted  




Output:  
• Need matrix  
• If asked about safe state : Answer with yes or no , showing the sequence of
processes that will create a safe state if yes.   
• If asked about immediate requests : Answer with yes or no , showing the
sequence of processes that will create a safe state if yes.
